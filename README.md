## 🔥 News
- **2026.5.07**: 🔥🔥 We have open-sourced InternAgent-1.5 with advanced features, including  enhanced algorithm discovery tasks, autonomous scientific paper reproduction, memory module, and deep research for tackling complex research challenges.

- **2026.3.17**: 🚀🚀 We provide public [access](https://scphub.intern-ai.org.cn/detail/28) to InternAgent's Deep Research capabilities, enabling developers and researchers to seamlessly integrate its advanced deep research functionality into their own workflows.

- **2026.2.14**: ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 We open-source **[MLEvolve](https://github.com/InternScience/MLEvolve)**, the core implementation of InternAgent's solution optimization subsystem for algorithm design tasks. As the **open-source method** to achieve **#1 on MLEBench**, MLEvolve demonstrates powerful capabilities in solution optimization within bounded hypothesis spaces.

- **2026.2.10**: 🔥 Official release of the [InternAgent 1.5 Technical Report](https://huggingface.co/papers/2602.08990). InternAgent 1.5 achieves leading performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks including **GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience**, and supports end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery tasks across **Physical, Biology, Earth, and Life Science domains**, enabling both algorithm discovery and empirical discovery (dry/wet-lab experiments).

- **2025.10.13**: InternAgent-1.0 code has been fully open-sourced, supporting end-to-end automation and autonomous evolution across 12 scientific research tasks.

<summary>more...</summary>

- **2025.07.17**: The source code of InternAgent has been partially open-sourced. The complete version of InternAgent (covering 12 types of tasks for autonomous scientific research) will be open-sourced soon. This code repository can be used for full-cycle autonomous scientific research, ranging from hypothesis generation to automated experimental execution.

- **2025.07.10**: *NovelSeek* has been renamed to **InternAgent**. This change embodies our hopeful vision for autonomous scientific research framework, and we hope it will empower all researchers to achieve great scientific discoveries.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
conda create -n InternAgent python=3.11
conda activate InternAgent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure API Keys

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys:

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

Key fields in `.env`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=        # OpenAI or compatible API key (used for embeddings and memory)
OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=   # Base URL for OpenAI-compatible endpoints
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=    # OpenRouter API key (when using the openrouter provider)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=     # Anthropic API key (for Claude-based experiment backends)
```

To use OpenRouter as the model gateway, set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and run with
`config/openrouter_config.yaml`. See [docs/openrouter.md](docs/openrouter.md)
for setup details.

### Run a Discovery Experiment

`AutoDebug` is a self-contained toy task (no dataset or model downloads required) and is the recommended first run to verify your setup.

```bash
python launch_discovery.py \
    --config ./config/default_config.yaml \
    --task AutoDebug \
    --exp_backend claudecode
```

### Run a QA Query

QA mode uses InternAgent's deep research pipeline to answer a research question directly — no experiment loop, just a synthesized answer grounded in literature.

```bash
python launch_qa.py --question "What are recent advances in memory-augmented LLMs?"

# Optionally save the answer to a file
python launch_qa.py -q "What are recent advances in memory-augmented LLMs?" -o answer.md
```

### Master Launcher

`launch.py` is a unified entry point for both modes:

```bash
python launch.py --mode discovery --task AutoDebug --exp_backend claudecode
python launch.py --mode qa --question "What are recent advances in memory-augmented LLMs?"
```

**Configuration tips:**
- Configuration lives in `config/` — `default_config.yaml` is the main starting point.
- Results are saved under `results/`, logs under `logs/`.
- To skip idea generation and run experiments from existing ideas: add `--skip_idea_generation --idea_path <path/to/ideas.json>`.
- See `scripts/` for ready-to-use example scripts.

### Research Tasks

**Algorithm discovery tasks** live under `tasks/`. Each contains a `prompt.json` (task description), baseline `code/`, and a `launcher.sh`. Datasets and environment-specific setup vary per task — refer to the code in each task folder.

**Scientific paper reproduction tasks** (`sci_tasks`) are a distinct mode where InternAgent is given a published paper and its data, and asked to reproduce the key findings autonomously. These tasks live under `sci_tasks/tasks/` (from the [ResearchClawBench](https://github.com/InternScience/ResearchClawBench) benchmark). See [docs/sci_tasks.md](docs/sci_tasks.md) for a full guide.

### Quick-Start Scripts

Ready-to-use example scripts are provided under `scripts/`:

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `run_discovery.sh` | Run a full discovery experiment (idea generation → experiments) |
| `run_skip-idea.sh` | Run experiments from an existing idea file, skipping generation |
| `run_sci.sh` | Run a scientific paper reproduction task (defaults to `Astronomy_000`) |
| `run_qa.sh` | Answer a research question via deep research |

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Memory Module

InternAgent 1.5 includes a persistent memory module that records experiment outcomes across sessions, helping the agent avoid previously failed directions and build on successful ones. See [docs/memory_module.md](docs/memory_module.md) for configuration and setup.

### Deep Research

The Deep Research (DR) module decomposes a research question into subtasks, gathers information from academic databases and the web in parallel, and synthesizes findings into a direct answer or structured report. See [docs/deep_research.md](docs/deep_research.md) for configuration and setup.
