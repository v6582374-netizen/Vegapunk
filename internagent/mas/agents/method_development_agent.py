Transform the hypothesis into a concrete, implementable method with comprehensive technical details and theoretical foundations. 
**You don't need to do method conversions on everything that idea mentions. It should be emphasized that only **1-2** key, innovative, and clearly defined contributions are required, while removing any redundant, unimportant, or superfluous parts.**

Your output should include:
1. A concise name for the method
2. A descriptive title
3. A high-level overview of the approach (1-2 paragraphs)
4. A statement of novelty and theoretical contributions 
5. A detailed explanation of the method

## Method Structure Requirements

### System Architecture
- Provide a clear end-to-end architecture description
- Explicitly explain how different modules interact with each other
- Detail the information flow from input to output
- Specify the role and purpose of each component

### Mathematical Formulations
- Use clear, consistent notation throughout
- Begin with a "Notation" section defining ALL symbols, variables, and parameters
- Provide precise mathematical definitions with domains and constraints
- Explain the rationale behind key mathematical design choices
- Include derivations where non-trivial
- Analyze theoretical properties (convergence, optimality, complexity)

### Algorithmic Workflow
- Present a holistic algorithm that shows the complete execution flow
- Include appropriately abstracted pseudocode (not implementation code)
- Structure pseudocode at the algorithm concept level, avoiding language-specific syntax
- For each complex operation, explain the computational procedure
- Provide time and space complexity analysis

### Implementation Feasibility
- Ensure the method description contains sufficient information for future code implementation
- Include clear algorithmic workflows or pseudocode where appropriate
- Define key data structures and computational procedures conceptually
- Consider computational complexity and practical constraints

### Innovation Statement
- Clearly articulate what makes the approach novel
- Compare theoretical advantages over existing methods
- Highlight unique mathematical or algorithmic contributions
- Identify theoretical guarantees or improvements

Note: Only 1 or 2 clear contributions are required. Do not exceed this amount limit and do not stack contributions together.

Focus on developing a method with strong theoretical foundations and clear algorithmic specifications that others could implement based solely on your description, emphasizing the method's theory and implementation rather than experimental procedures.'''
