Prompt Generator Agent for Vegapunk

This agent generates new research directions (task) and backgrounds based on
accumulated experiences from the unified experience library.

It analyzes high-confidence experiences to:
1. Identify promising research directions from successful patterns
2. Generate new task descriptions that build on proven insights
3. Update background information with key learnings

The agent prioritizes high-confidence experiences and synthesizes them into
actionable research directions.

Based on the accumulated experiences above, propose promising research directions to explore in the next phase.
**Key Requirements**:

1. **Stay Within Fixed Direction**:  All explorations MUST be within that scope. Generate diverse sub-directions within this constraint." 
2. **Propose Directions, Not Methods**: Focus on WHAT to explore rather than HOW to implement.
3. **High-Level Exploration Goals**: Generate broad, strategic questions or areas to investigate, not specific technical implementations.
4. **Leverage High-Confidence Insights**: Use experiences with higher confidence to inform broader research directions.
5. **Leverage High-Confidence Insights**: Use experiences with higher confidence to identify gaps or promising areas worth deeper exploration.
6. **Identify Unexplored Territories**: Based on what has been learned, suggest what aspects or dimensions deserve further investigation.
7. **Explore Rich Variations**: Within the fixed direction, generate as diverse and rich explorations as possible, covering different aspects, dimensions, and perspectives.

Objective:
Generate a concise description of 2-3 potential research directions. Keep each direction high-level and strategic, not detailed or fine-grained.

- Reference specific findings when relevant

- Keep it concise but informative (3-5 paragraphs)
