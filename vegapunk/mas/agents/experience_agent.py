Experience Agent for Vegapunk

This agent generates valuable experiences from experimental results through:
1. Evaluation: Assess whether runs show improvement over baseline
2. Contrastive Learning: Pairwise comparison of ideas to understand differences
3. Experience Synthesis: Extract generalizable insights from comparisons

The experiences capture what worked, what didn't, and why, providing
actionable guidance for future research.

## Your Task

Perform a detailed contrastive analysis of these two methods. Provide a focused comparison, emphasizing the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

**CRITICAL: Base your comparison on the BEST PERFORMANCE achieved by each method** (shown in the "BEST RUN SUMMARY" section at the end of each method's experiment results). Compare the best-performing run of Method A against the best-performing run of Method B, not just the first runs.

Analyze from the following dimensions:

1. **Technical Approach**: How do the core technical ideas differ? What are the main strengths of the better-performing method, and what weaknesses are evident in the method that performed worse? Focus on the algorithmic or architectural choices that made a difference.

2. **Implementation Complexity**: Which method was more challenging to implement? Identify any specific challenges or hurdles that may have contributed to poor performance in one of the methods.

3. **Performance Comparison**: Compare the BEST performance achieved by both methods. Which method's best run performed better, and by how much? Use the concrete metrics from the "BEST RUN SUMMARY" sections to illustrate the performance gap, and discuss why one method's best performance exceeded the other's.

4. **Reason for Success or Failure**: Analyze the causal factors behind the success of the better-performing method and the failure of the worse-performing method. What specific design choices or mistakes led to these results? What aspects of the method's design made it either more effective or less effective in achieving optimal performance?

## Important Guidelines

- **USE THE BEST RUN SUMMARY**: Always refer to the "BEST RUN SUMMARY" section for each method when making performance comparisons. This represents the peak capability of each method.
- Focus on identifying the key factors that differentiate the success or failure of the methods, based on their best experimental results.
- Provide clear, causal explanations for why one method's best performance exceeded the other's best performance.
- Be specific in your analysis, especially when it comes to the practical and theoretical aspects of each method's design.
- Consider both the strengths and weaknesses of each method, identifying areas of improvement for the method that performed worse even at its best.

Generate a comprehensive comparison analysis that helps explain the strengths and weaknesses of these methods in the context of this domain.

## Your Task

Synthesize **generalizable insights** from the above comparative analyses. Each experience should meet the following criteria:

1. **Name**: A concise and memorable title (2-5 words) that captures the essence of the insight.
2. **Type**: Specify whether the experience is related to **methodological insights** (e.g., general approach or framework) or **practical insights** (e.g., parameter tuning, implementation strategies).
3. **Content**: A concise, directional insight (2-3 sentences) that can guide future research or method development. The insight should focus on high-level principles, strategies, or patterns that emerged from the analysis. These should be **generalizable** and **actionable**, offering clear guidance for improving future work.
4. **Confidence**: Rate the confidence of the insight on a scale from 0 to 10, where:
   - 0-3: Low confidence, based on limited or inconsistent evidence.
   - 4-6: Medium confidence, supported by some evidence but not fully consistent.
   - 7-10: High confidence, supported by multiple comparisons with consistent evidence.

## Important Guidelines
- Each experience may describe: **What tends to work well** (positive, recommended patterns), or **What tends to fail or should be avoided** (negative, cautionary patterns)
- Focus on **generalizable** and **strategic** insights that will inform future research or development. Do not make the insights overly specific to a single comparison.
- Look for **patterns** that appear consistently across multiple analyses and extract the **big-picture lessons**.
- Prioritize **causal insights**: explain why certain outcomes occurred and identify the strategies that contributed to success or failure.
- Ensure that insights are **referenceable** and **concrete**, providing practical guidance for future work.
- You can generate **5-10 insights** that will help inform future research or method development in this domain.

Generate the insights that will guide future research and method development, highlighting both **positive** and **negative** experiences based on the comparative analyses.

## Context

You are helping to maintain an experience library for a research agent working in {task_domain}.

**Agent Objective**: Discover and validate effective research methods through systematic experimentation.

**Learning Objective**: {learning_objective}

## Your Task

Perform experience optimization by deciding how to integrate new experiences into the existing experience library. For each new experience, compare it with all existing experiences and choose one of four operations.

## Input

### Existing Experiences
{chr(10).join(existing_exp_list) if existing_exp_list else "No existing experiences in the library."}

### New Experiences
{chr(10).join([f"{i+1}. {exp}" for i, exp in enumerate(new_exp_list)])}

## Valid Operations

For each new experience, you must choose ONE of these operations:

1. **ADD**: The new experience contains entirely new information not present in any existing experience.
   - Use when the insight is genuinely novel
   - System will auto-generate an ID
   - Set `id` field to `null`

2. **UPDATE**: The new experience refines, expands, or improves an existing experience.
   - Use when new experience adds meaningful details to an existing one
   - Use when new experience adds nuance or slightly conflicts with existing
   - Synthesize to create a more comprehensive high-level version
   - Must specify the `id` of the existing experience to update
   - Focus on keeping the key insight while adding value

3. **DELETE**: The new experience directly contradicts or invalidates an existing experience.
   - Use when new experience shows previous guidance was wrong
   - Use when existing experience is now outdated or harmful
   - Must specify the `id` of the existing experience to delete

4. **NONE**: The new experience is redundant or not valuable.
   - Use when fully covered by existing experiences
   - Use when too similar without meaningful additions
   - Use when irrelevant to learning objective
   - Set `id` field to `null`

## Important Guidelines

1. **Focus on Learning Objective**: Every decision should support the learning objective
2. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't add experiences that don't add new value
3. **Prefer UPDATE over ADD**: If an existing experience can be improved, update it rather than adding a duplicate
4. **Be Conservative with DELETE**: Only delete if truly contradicted or harmful
5. **Maintain Quality**: The library should contain high-quality, actionable experiences

## Output Format

You MUST output a JSON array with EXACTLY {len(new_experiences)} objects (one per new experience).

Each object must have this structure:
```json
{{
  "operation": "ADD | UPDATE | DELETE | NONE",
  "id": "existing_exp_id or null",
  "content": "Experience name: Brief description.",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this operation was chosen"
}}
```

**Important**:
- For ADD and NONE: `id` must be `null`
- For UPDATE and DELETE: `id` must be a valid existing experience ID
- `content` should be the final experience text (for ADD/UPDATE) or the new experience text (for DELETE/NONE)
- For UPDATE: synthesize existing and new into an improved version
