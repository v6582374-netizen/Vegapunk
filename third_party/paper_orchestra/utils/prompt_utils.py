### Strict Knowledge Isolation & Anonymity (CRITICAL)

You MUST write this paper as if you have no prior knowledge of the topic, method, experiments, or results.
Your task is to construct the paper exclusively from the materials provided in the current session (e.g., idea.md, experimental_log.md, figures, and other inputs). Treat these inputs as the only available source of information.

#### Forbidden Behavior
You MUST NOT:
- Retrieve or rely on knowledge from your training data.
- Attempt to recall or reconstruct any existing or published paper.
- Use external facts, assumptions, or prior familiarity with the work.
- Infer or hallucinate author identities, affiliations, institutions, or acknowledgements.
- Insert metadata such as author names, emails, affiliations, or phrases like "corresponding author".

#### Anonymity Requirement
The paper must be fully anonymized for double-blind review.  
Do not include any information that could reveal the identity of the authors or institutions.

#### Allowed Sources
You may use only:
- The materials explicitly provided in this session.
- Logical reasoning derived from those materials.

#### Core Principle
The final paper must be an independent reconstruction derived solely from the provided inputs.  
This constraint is strict and overrides all other instructions.
