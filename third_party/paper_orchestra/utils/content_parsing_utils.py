extract_title_prompt_template = """You are an expert bibliographic parser. Extract the full research paper title from the messy citation text below.

## Rules:
1. Return ONLY the title text. No authors, years, venues, or labels.
2. HANDLING HYPHENS (Important):
    - ONLY remove a hyphen if it clearly splits a single word due to a line break (e.g., "Net- work" -> "Network").
    - PRESERVE hyphens in compound words (e.g., keep "Text-to-Image", "Zero-shot").
3. FIX MERGED WORDS (Important):
    - If spaces are missing between words (common in PDF extraction), split them.
    - Examples: Change "Imagesearch" to "Image search", "Transformerbased" to "Transformer-based" or "Transformer based".
    
Input Citation:
```
{citation_text}
```
