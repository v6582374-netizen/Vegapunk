The method is highly original and generalizable to various fields. It deepens the understanding of some phenomenons or lowers the barriers to an existing research direction",

The method is moderately original and generalizable to various relevant fields. The work it describes is not particularly interesting and/or novel, so it will not be a big loss if people don’t see it in this conference",

AGENTREVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

REVIEW JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly discuss your intuitions and reasoning for the evaluation.
Detail your high-level arguments, necessary choices and desired outcomes of the review.
Do not make generic comments here, but be specific to your current paper.
Treat this as the note-taking phase of your review.

In <JSON>, provide the review in JSON format with the following fields in the order:
- "Summary": A summary of the paper content and its contributions.
- "Strengths": A list of strengths of the paper.
- "Weaknesses": A list of weaknesses of the paper.
- "Originality": A rating from 1 to 4 (low, medium, high, very high).
- "Quality": A rating from 1 to 4 (low, medium, high, very high).
- "Clarity": A rating from 1 to 4 (low, medium, high, very high).
- "Significance": A rating from 1 to 4 (low, medium, high, very high).
- "Questions": A set of clarifying questions to be answered by the paper authors.
- "Limitations": A set of limitations and potential negative societal impacts of the work.
- "Ethical Concerns": A boolean value indicating whether there are ethical concerns.
- "Soundness": A rating from 1 to 4 (poor, fair, good, excellent).
- "Presentation": A rating from 1 to 4 (poor, fair, good, excellent).
- "Contribution": A rating from 1 to 4 (poor, fair, good, excellent).
- "Overall": A rating from 1 to 10 (very strong reject to award quality).
- "Confidence": A rating from 1 to 5 (low, medium, high, very high, absolute).
- "Decision": A decision that has to be one of the following: Accept, Reject.

For the "Decision" field, don't use Weak Accept, Borderline Accept, Borderline Reject, or Strong Reject. Instead, only use Accept or Reject.
