## Deep Research

FlowSearch: The Deep Research (DR) module is Vegapunk's built-in literature and web research pipeline. Given a question or research topic, it decomposes the task into subtasks, gathers information in parallel from academic databases and the web, and synthesizes the findings into a structured answer or report. It is the backbone of QA mode and is also used during idea generation in discovery runs to ground hypotheses in existing literature.

**When is it useful?**

Use it whenever a task requires going beyond what is already in the agent's context — surveying a research area, verifying a claim against recent papers, or producing a standalone research answer. In discovery mode it runs in the background to inform idea generation; in QA mode it runs directly in response to a user question.

---

### Modes

The DR module has two output modes:

| Mode | Output | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `qa` | Concise direct answer | Single factual or research questions |
| `report` | Structured markdown report with sections and references | Surveys, in-depth backgrounds, multi-part topics |

QA mode skips outline generation and section polishing, making it significantly faster. Report mode runs a full multi-stage synthesis pipeline and optionally polishes each section.

---

### Configuration in Discovery Mode

When running a discovery experiment, DR is controlled by the `agents.dr` block in `config/default_config.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  dr:
    enabled: true              # Set to false to disable DR background research entirely
    mode: "simple"             # Which DR config to use: "simple" or "complex"
                               #   simple  → config_simple.yaml (faster, no coordinator)
                               #   complex → config_complex.yaml (thorough, with coordinator)
```

Disabling DR (`enabled: false`) skips background literature grounding during idea generation — useful when running offline or when API rate limits are a concern.

DR receives the process-owned `UnifiedModelRuntime` and uses the Catalog Active Text Model for all roles.
The declared Responses protocol supports ordinary `previous_response_id` continuation when the binding declares it.
Provider-side background execution is disabled.

### Configuration

Three pre-built configs are provided under `vegapunk/mas/agents/dr_agents/`:

| Config file | Mode | Coordinator | Polish | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `config_qa.yaml` | `qa` | off | off | Direct question answering (~5–10 min) |
| `config_simple.yaml` | `report` | off | off | Quick background research (~10–20 min) |
| `config_complex.yaml` | `report` | on | on | Comprehensive reports (~20–40 min) |

The coordinator is an optional validation stage that checks research completeness and adds follow-up subtasks if gaps are found. Enabling it improves quality at the cost of additional time and API calls.

Key parameters to tune:

```yaml
main:
  max_iter: 5              # Maximum execution cycles; increase for more thorough research
  enable_coordinator: false # Set true for quality validation loops (complex config only)

global_planner:
  max_nodes: 7             # Number of research subtasks generated; higher = broader coverage

global_execution:
  max_workers: 10          # Parallel threads; reduce if hitting API rate limits
  execution:
    max_tool_calls: 5      # Tool calls per subtask

synthesizer:
  mode: "qa"               # "qa" for direct answers, omit for report mode
  polish: false            # Set true to refine each section (report mode only)
```

To override a DR workflow setting programmatically, keep the shared project config and pass only the workflow override:

```python
import yaml
from vegapunk.mas.agents.dr_agent import DRAgent
from vegapunk.mas.models.unified_runtime import UnifiedModelRuntime

with open("config/default_config.yaml", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    project_config = yaml.safe_load(file)

runtime = UnifiedModelRuntime.from_catalog_path(project_config["model_catalog_path"])
agent = DRAgent(
    model=runtime.model_for(capability="text"),
    config={
        "mode": "qa",
        "workflow_config": {"main": {"max_iter": 3}},
        "_global_config": project_config,
        "_runtime": runtime,
    },
)
```

### API Keys and Environment Setup

The DR module uses five search tools. Required keys depend on which tools are enabled.

#### `arxiv_search`
Searches preprints on arXiv. No API key required.

#### `openalex_search`
Searches the OpenAlex academic database (250M+ works across all disciplines). No key required, but set an email for polite access:

```
OPENALEX_EMAIL=you@example.com
```

#### `crossref_search`
Searches CrossRef for DOI metadata and citations (150M+ records). No key required, but set an email:

```
CROSSREF_EMAIL=you@example.com
```

#### `volc_search`
Web search via Volcengine, with strong Chinese-language support and automatic full-text extraction. Requires an enterprise API key:

```
VOLC_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-key
```

#### `url_processor`
Fetches and extracts content from a URL, then answers a specific query against it. Uses Tavily as the primary extractor (fast and clean), falling back to Volcengine if unavailable:

```
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-your-key
```

Add these to your `.env` file alongside the existing OpenAI keys.

### Standalone Usage

QA mode is the primary standalone entry point. Report mode is used internally by the discovery pipeline — if you need it outside of a discovery run, instantiate `DRAgent` directly with a report config (see [Configuration](#configuration) above).

**QA mode** (direct question answering):

```bash
python launch_qa.py --question "What are recent advances in memory-augmented LLMs?" \
                    --config config/default_config.yaml \
                    --output answer.md
```

Pass a local file with `--file` to ground the answer in a specific document (e.g. a paper PDF or notes):

```bash
python launch_qa.py --question "What methodology does this paper use?" \
                    --file path/to/paper.pdf \
                    --output answer.md
```

To invoke `DRAgent` directly (e.g. with a custom config):

```python
from vegapunk.mas.agents.dr_agent import DRAgent
import asyncio
import yaml
from vegapunk.mas.models.unified_runtime import UnifiedModelRuntime

with open("config/default_config.yaml", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    project_config = yaml.safe_load(file)

runtime = UnifiedModelRuntime.from_catalog_path(project_config["model_catalog_path"])
agent = DRAgent(
    model=runtime.model_for(capability="text"),
    config={"mode": "qa", "_global_config": project_config, "_runtime": runtime},
)
answer = asyncio.run(agent.execute({'task': 'Your research question'}, {}))
print(answer)
```
